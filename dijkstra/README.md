## Graph Properties

## Functional Programming and Cyclic Structures

When trying to represent a graph in a functional programming language, one might run into the following problem: creating nodes `A` and `B`, where `A` points to `B` and `B` points to `A`. How to create one without the other? Haskel uses a concept called [Tying the Knot](https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot) to solve this problem.
